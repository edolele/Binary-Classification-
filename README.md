# Autoencoder
<h1><b> INTRODUCTION </b></h1>
<p1>This is a keras tensorflow backend model, which 1st reduce dimensions of the input data using convolutional autoencoders.
    and then by transfer learning reduced dimensions are futher used for classification task </p1>
<h2><b2> USAGE: </b2></h2>
<p2>Install keras with tensorflow backend better with gpu then 1st run autoencoder.py then model file will be created which contains saved model the run classifier.py </p2>
